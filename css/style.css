/* 
Step 2: Edit the body element to use the Poppins font (using Google fonts) with serif as a backup.  It should also use the image “concrete_seamless.png” as a background-image with a backup color of #f1f1f1.

*/

body {
    font-family: "Poppins", serif; /* use Poppins from Google fonts */
    background-image: url("../images/concrete_seamless.png"); /* get the parent directory & access concrete_seamless image in images folder */
    background-color: #f1f1f1; /* backup color */

}

/*
Step 3: Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) to use flex to match our example.
*/
header {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center; /* put nav list items: about, prices, gallery in center */
    flex-direction: column;
}

/* 
Step 6: Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following: 
background: #288088,
solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners. 
*/

.card > header { /* only get header inside card class - descendant advanced css selector */
    background: #288088;
    border: solid 2px #45ADAD;
    padding: 20px 0;
    border-top-left-radius: 50px;
    border-top-right-radius: 50px;
}

/* 
Step 4: Edit the css for the nav_links class to use flex to match our example. Do not modify the list items or the links - modify the nav_links class to use flex. 
*/

.nav_links {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column; /* make sure nav list items are in column format since it is default in row format when selecting .nav_links */
}

/* 
Step 5: Style the links so that they have the same color even after they have been visited.
