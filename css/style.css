    background-image: url("../images/concrete_seamless.png"); /* get the parent directory & access concrete_seamless image in images folder */
    background-color: #f1f1f1; /* backup color */

/*
Step 3: Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) to use flex to match our example.
*/

    flex-direction: column;
    /* justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 10px 20px; */
}

/* 
Step 6: Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following: 
background: #288088,
solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
50px border-radius on the top left and right corners. 
*/

.card { /* makes sure both header and parent .card have matching border-radius setting */
    border-top-left-radius: 50px;
    border-top-right-radius: 50px; /* apply rounded corners to the card itself */
}

.card > header { /* only get header inside card class - descendant advanced css selector */
    background: #288088;
    border: solid 2px #45ADAD;
    padding: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
    border-top-left-radius: 50px;
    border-top-right-radius: 50px;
}

/* 
Step 4: Edit the css for the nav_links class to use flex to match our example. Do not modify the list items or the links - modify the nav_links class to use flex. 
*/

.nav_links {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column; /* make sure nav list items are in column format since it is default in row format when selecting .nav_links */
}

/* 
Step 5: Style the links so that they have the same color even after they have been visited.
*/

.nav_links a:link,
.nav_links a:visited {
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: underline;
}


/* 
Step 7: Edit the css for the card class to match our example. Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial ‚Äúsize‚Äù of 450px.  You need to think about this from a ‚Äúflex‚Äù perspective and realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.

Step 8: Edit the css for the pricing class to match our example. You should use flex and the cards should be centered both horizontally and vertically.

.pricing { /* align cards horizontally & vertically */
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: row wrap;
    justify-content: center;
}


/* 
Step 9: Style the images in the gallery class. These elements will have a solid 10px border with a color of #50C7C7, 10px margin on all four sides and a width of 300px.
*/

.gallery img {
    border: solid 10px #50C7C7;

    width: 300px;

/* Step 10: Edit the css for the gallery class to use flex to match our example.  */
.gallery {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

/* 
Step 11: Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) and the nav_links class to match our example using flex-properties. The logo should be as far to the left as possible and the links as far to the right as possible. Use flex properties, NOT position properties.
